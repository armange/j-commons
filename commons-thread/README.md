# Commons-thread

This release is being created based on the need to simplify daily software development tasks.

The first version contains a framework that simplifies segmentation for some specific scenarios that may be routine for some types of software projects.

##### The tasks simplified by this lib thread are:
- Thread delayed.
- Thread timed out.
- Thread loop.
- Exception handling.
- The combination of these factors together.
