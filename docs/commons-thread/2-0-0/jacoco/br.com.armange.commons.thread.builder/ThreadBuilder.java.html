 *     &lt;li&gt;
 *          &lt;b&gt;CommonRunnableThreadBuilder:&lt;/b&gt; To implement threads that run tasks

 *     &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;
 *          &lt;b&gt;TimingRunnableThreadBuilder:&lt;/b&gt; To implement threads that run tasks
 *          but do not need to return values after execution. However, they can be configured
 *          with scheduling options such as delay, interval or timeout, for example.
 *          See {@link #setScheduling(Runnable)}
 *     &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;
 *          &lt;b&gt;CommonCallableThreadBuilder:&lt;/b&gt; To implement threads that execute tasks
